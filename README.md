# dijkstra-algorithm
Implementation and simulation of dijkstra's algorithm in C++

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a directed graph

## Notes
Input text file's first integer is the number of nodes present in the directed graph
and subsequent triplets on each line represent an edge (from a to b) along with it's cost.

Example: 1 2 3 (Edge from Node 1 to Node 2 that has the cost(distance) of 3 units)
Example: 3 10 100 (Edge from Node 3 to Node 10 that has the cost(distance) of 100 units)
Example: 4 4 0 (Edge from Node 4 to itself that has the cost(distance) of 0 units)

Sample data.txt for input file is given along with resulting output files (output1.txt, output2.txt)
